## Updating Models and Context from Database

If you want to synchronize your Entity Framework models and DbContext with the current state of your database, you can leverage the reverse engineering capabilities of Entity Framework Core. This process creates code that represents the current state of your database. This is useful if you have made changes to your database schema and want to update your models and DbContext to reflect those changes.

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that you have the Entity Framework CLI installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
  ```

### Steps to Reverse Engineer the Database:

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: 
   Open a new terminal windowand navigate to the project directory where you want to update the models and context. For example:
   ```
   cd backend/src/UserApi
   ```

2. **Run the Reverse Engineering Command**: 
   Execute the following Entity Framework CLI command to scaffold (generate) the models and DbContext based on the existing database schema. Make sure to replace `ConnectionStrings:UserDb` with the actual name of your connection string configured in your `appsettings.json` file or the exact connection string itself.
   ```
   dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Name=ConnectionStrings:UserDb" Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL -o Entities
   ```

   - `"Name=ConnectionStrings:UserDb"`: Specifies the name of the connection string to use for the database connection. This should be configured in your `appsettings.json` file.
   - `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`: Specifies the provider to use, which is Npgsql for PostgreSQL in this case.
   - `-o Entities`: Specifies the output folder where the generated models and DbContext should be placed. This will be inside the `Entities` folder in your project.

3. **Review and Integrate the Generated Code**: 
   After running the command, review the generated code in the `Entities` folder. Integrate any necessary changes into your project, and resolve any conflicts with existing code.

4. **Compile and Test Your Project**: 
   Make sure to compile your project and run any existing tests to ensure that the reverse engineering process has not introduced any issues.

### Important Note:
- The reverse engineering process will overwrite existing files in the output directory. Make sure to backup your current models and DbContext if you have made any manual changes that you want to preserve.
